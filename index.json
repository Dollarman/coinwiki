This website has several goals:  To provide a source of information free of news, active development or speculation. We inform what is available and usable right now. The core of this site is to contruct a wiki based on objective data with sources and provide open source data analysis from common exchanges. Looking forward to add more exchanges for graph data, and add more coins to the mix. In the spirit of keeping the site objective, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep my own articles section away from the main navigation, but may be reached here  "
